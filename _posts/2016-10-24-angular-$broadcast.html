<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Hind, sans-serif; font-size: small; text-align: justify;">AngularJS applications may need to communicate across the controllers. Such a communication might be needed to send notifications or to pass data between the controllers. Although there can be different approaches to achieve this goal, one that is readily available is the event system of $scope and $rootScope. Both of these objects - $scope and $rootScope - support three methods namely $broadcast(), $emit() and $on() that facilitate event driven publisher-subscriber model for sending notifications and passing data between the controllers. In this article I will discuss how to raise events using $broadcast() and $emit() and then how to handle those events using $on().</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Hind, sans-serif; text-align: justify;">after&nbsp;</span>authenticationSuccess call this :</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;">$rootScope.$broadcast('authenticationSuccess');</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">and listen to that event&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;">$scope.$on('authenticationSuccess', function() {</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; getAccount();</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">&nbsp;});</span></p>
