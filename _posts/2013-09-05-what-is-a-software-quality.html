<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Quality(T) = Changeability(T) / Known defects(T)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">What can we say about software quality and defects?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Software quality is inversely proportion to the number of defects in the system: high quality implies few defects and vice versa</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Defects have undesirable consequences</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Defects incur costs, in all likelihood financial costs but there are others, time in particular. Even if defects are not fixed they will incur costs, e.g. over payments from a financial system or people ringing the helpline to report a spelling mistake</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Removing defects requires rework and rework costs time and money</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">define &ldquo;Easy to change&rdquo;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Change is localized</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Change is less error-prone &ndash; perhaps better stated as &ldquo;change does not inject defect&rdquo; (Somewhere in Jones writing he suggests 7% of defect fixes inject new defects so high quality software would have a bad fix injection rate less than 7%)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Change is more maintainable, i.e. changing software does not detract from the changeability of the software</span></li>
</ul>
