<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;">A reverse proxy is mostly a server-side concept, and is usually used in the context of CDNs (content distribution networks) for caching static HTTP content. A forward proxy is usually a client side concept used for anonymity, to subvert censorship, and (back in the days of dial-up) as a web accelerator.</span></p>
