<h2>80:20 Who uses What, What do you Really have to Deliver</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Another well-known 80:20 rule in software is that 80% of users only use 20% of features. This came out of research from the <a href="http://luuduong.com/blog/archive/2009/03/04/applying-the-quot8020-rulequot-with-the-standish-groups-software-usage.aspx">Standish Group back in 2002</a>, where they found that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">45% of features were never used; </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"> 19% used rarely; </span></li>
<li>16% sometimes;</li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"> only 20% were used frequently or always.</span></li>
</ul>
