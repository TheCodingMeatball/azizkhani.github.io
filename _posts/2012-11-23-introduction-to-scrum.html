<p>This post is an introduction to Scrum, one of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2012/11/introduction-to-agile-principles.html" target="_blank">Agile</a> methods to drive software application implementation. Reading this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2012/11/introduction-to-agile-principles.html" target="_blank">post</a> is a prerequisite to this post.</p>
<p><strong> Concepts </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Scrum projects</em> deliver software application features iteratively.</li>
<li>Each iteration is called a <em><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>sprint</strong></span>.</em></li>
<li>Scrum projects have 4 stages:
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Planning</em></strong> &ndash; Definition of the vision, budget, and expectations. The first version of the product backlog should containing enough implementation items for the first sprint.</li>
<li><strong><em>Staging</em></strong> &ndash; This is the first iteration where the requirements and product backlog created in the planning are refined.</li>
<li><strong><em>Development</em></strong> &ndash; It is the set of sprints required to implement the project fully. It ends when the product backlog is empty.</li>
<li><strong><em>Release</em></strong> &ndash; The final product is deployed, training is performed, documentation is finalized, etc&hellip; The release backlog can be used as the product backlog for the next release of the product.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are 4 main roles in scrum projects: team member, product owner, stakeholders and scrum master:
<ul>
<li>A <strong><em>product owner</em></strong> is a customer representative acting as a single point of contact on the customer side.</li>
<li>A <strong><em>stakeholder</em></strong> is anyone having a vested interest in the project, providing information about requirements and participating to the decision process of features to be implemented.</li>
<li>A <strong><em>scrum master</em></strong> is a facilitator and single point of contact on the development team side. It is a support function, not a &lsquo;controlling chief&rsquo; role. It is a mix between a team leader and a software engineering role, which does not include people management or profit &amp; lost responsibilities.</li>
<li>A <em><strong>team member</strong></em> is a software engineer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Scrum of scrum</em> can be implemented when multiple scrum teams are working on the same large project. Scrum master and product representatives get together.</li>
<li>The <strong><em>product backlog</em></strong> is a list of features, use cases, enhancement, defect, etc&hellip; to be implemented in the project&rsquo;s forthcoming sprints.</li>
<li>The <strong><em>release backlog</em></strong> is the list of features, uses cases, enhancement, defect, etc&hellip; which are postponed to the next version of the project (not next sprint).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br /> <strong> Practice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spring teams typically <strong>do not have more than 7 members</strong>.</li>
<li>A sprint duration is <strong>30 days</strong>.</li>
<li>Scrum projects are <strong>client-driven</strong>. They select the features to be implemented.</li>
<li>Each sprint begins with two meetings:
<ul>
<li>The stakeholder meeting, with the scrum master and customer representative to re-prioritize the product backlog and update the release backlog.</li>
<li>The product owner and team meeting where tasks are created from the product backlog.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each <strong>task</strong> must require <strong>between 4 and 16 hours of work</strong>. Bigger tasks must be subdivided into smaller tasks.</li>
<li>The scrum master and product owner check whether there are enough resources to support the efforts required to achieve the sprint and adjust the workload accordingly.</li>
<li>Team member pick their tasks and work on their implementations.</li>
<li>Each spring finishes with a presentation of implemented features to the stakeholders.</li>
<li>Every day, a stand-up meeting (15-20 mins) with the team members and eventually the product owner is organized in front of a white board. The following is discussed:
<ul>
<li>Which tasks have been achieved since the last meeting?</li>
<li>Are there new tasks? New requirements?</li>
<li>What is blocking? Any impediments?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If decisions have to be taken, the Scrum Master should take them quickly, within an hour if possible</li>
<li>The Scrum Master should deal quickly with any impediments and communication issues</li>
<li>Scrum teams should preferably operate from the same room</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br /> <strong> Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>As for all Agile methods, the Scrum approach is best suited for new projects created from scratch. Over time, when successive application releases are implemented, the project can slowly transform into a continuous integration or even maintenance project, where less stakeholders input or daily supervision is required. The cogs are well oiled and operate naturally.</p>
