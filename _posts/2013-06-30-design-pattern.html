<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Don&rsquo;t use patterns unless you need to.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Don&rsquo;t use patterns that you don&rsquo;t fully understand.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Don&rsquo;t expect that whoever is going to work on the code in the future to recognize and understand the patterns that you used &ndash; stick to common patterns, and make them explicit in comments where you think it is important or necessary.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">When you&rsquo;re changing code, take some time to look for and understand the patterns that might be in place, and decide whether it is worth preserving (or restoring) them: whether doing this will really make the code better and more understandable.</span></li>
