<p>Before checking in the code, each developer should make sure that:<br />1. Should have a Unit/Integration Test for the change/new feature<br />2. Run Code Quality Checking tools(FindBugs/PMD/Sonar) on the changed code<br />3. The changes should comply with the existing architecture/design of the application.</p>
